This is a cheatsheet for Ruby beginners and contains links to resources and
some simple examples to get started with Ruby.

## Installation

**Linux/OSX**: [RVM](https://rvm.io/rvm/install/) or the Ruby Version Manager
is best way to manage Ruby installations on Linux and Mac OSX.

**Windows**: [RubyInstaller](http://rubyinstaller.org/) is the quickest way to
get Ruby installed on Windows.

### Objects and classes

**Defining a class**:

    class Foo
      def initialize(name)
        @name = name
      end
    end

This creates a class called Foo. Classes are always named in CamelCase.

**Constructor**: The constructor method for a class should be named 
`initialize`. It gets called whenever a new instance of the class is created.

**Instance variable**: Variables that are prefixed with @ are instance 
variables. Here, @name is an instance variable of class Foo.

**Creating objects**: Create an object `foo` which is an instance of class Foo 
and initialize it with the name "bar".

    foo = Foo.new("bar")
